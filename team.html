                             - her graduation project was a practical investigation about monsters, 
                             and her master's degree was focused on the representation of the female

                        <p>RAFAELA NUNES is an artist and researcher currently studying for a PhD in Multimedia 
                            Art at the Faculty of Fine Arts of Lisbon, where she completed her Master's 
                            degree in Painting. She is part of the Interactive Technologies Institute (ITI/LARSyS) 
                            and the eGames Lab. Her transmedia practice-based research intersects painting with 
                            digital technologies, exploring speculative futures through the creation of hybrids, 
                            combining practices like painting, programming, sculpture and artificial intelligence. 
                            Her research focuses on understanding how posthumanism transforms creative practices' paradigms.</p>

                            distinguished by a methodological framework that incorporates ludic and speculative 
                            workshops designed to foster critical socio-political inquiry. He has conducted 
                            these workshops across diverse international contexts, including Portugal, 
                            Greece, and Kenya, where he integrates speculative design, extended reality (XR) 
                            experiences, and critical play to interrogate and engage with complex socio-political issues.</p>

                        <p>NUNO LUÍS GAMITO BAPTISTA holds a Bachelor's degree in Multimedia Art, specializing 
                            in Digital Drawing, from the Faculty of Fine Arts (University of Lisbon). 
                            He has undertaken projects aimed at challenging and deconstructing urban landscapes 
                            through various dynamics within digital environments, drawing inspiration from fractals. 
                            Currently, he is a master's student in Multimedia Art at the same institution, focusing 
                            on Interactive Arts under the supervision of Professor Patrícia Gouveia. His artistic research 
                            centres on the study and creation of landscapes, with the goal of exploring the evolution and 
                            corruption of landscapes. He aims to question the limits of the digital medium and humanity's 
                            impacts on the finite resources of the world through an art-centric lens, combining procedural 
                            modelling and simulation techniques with research about the medium, discipline and tradition of the landscape.</p>
